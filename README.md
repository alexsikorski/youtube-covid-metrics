## Brief (fictional client)
Client demands for software that can obtain metrics of video engagement and performance in a certain time period. COVID-19 related videos should be identified through certain keywords/topics established in the video data obtained.
These specific metrics are required for analysis:

- Average views
- Average COVID-19 related views
- Average comment per view
- Average COVID-19 comment per view 
- Average shares per view
- Average COVID-19 shares per view

Data should be exported in a format where an excel file can be used to illustrate trends. This practice is important as the data needs to be human-readable and used for futher analysis.
