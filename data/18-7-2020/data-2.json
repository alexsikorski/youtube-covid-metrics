Cara is pregnant! Completely unexpected surprise pregnancy. For Gemma and the Triplets we tried for a year with no success, and later found out she has PCOS and doesn't ovulate correctly, so she got medical help and took a pill (letrozole) to help her ovulate and it did the trick for both pregnancies. We figured that if we wanted to get pregnant again she would have to go on that pill again. We weren't opposed to having more kids, but definitely thought at least 2 years before she got back on it. So this came out of nowhere. We truly believe everything happens for a reason, and that this baby is supposed to be a part of our family. Those struggling with infertility, we have family members going through the same thing, and although we will never know why certain things happen, we just pray that you will still stay strong and positive. Never give up! We are so excited for baby number 5 to join us and so are the kids! Their reaction videos were all filmed prior to this since we have known for 3 weeks, and we will show those soon. The main question we have is will it be multiples again??? Twins? Another triplet pregnancy?! haha that would be absolutely insane, but you never what will happen around here anymore.

On to Wembley next.\n\n#arsenal #liverpool #premierleaguehighlights \n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

Honestly, it would've gotten so confusing QUICK if I started throwing all these different names at you. Anywho, thank you guys so much for stopping by and hanging out with me.

Sorry I went a little MIA but I am happy to be back. Today I wanted to talk about Jim Jones and what was going on with his whole situation. This could easily be a 3 part series, there are so many more people and factors that came into play as well, but I wanted to keep it simple and focus on Jim and his life. Honestly, it would've gotten so confusing QUICK if I started throwing all these different names at you. Anywho, thank you guys so much for stopping by and hanging out with me. Hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day, Love and appreciate you guys so much!! I hope to be seeing you very soon \nx o\nBailey Sarian \n\nSources : \nhttps://bit.ly/2CtMBx6 \nhttps://bit.ly/2AZo2I6\nhttps://bit.ly/3ewYyQ8\nhttps://bit.ly/2OoiBpb \nhttps://bit.ly/2CvDcVW \n\n_______\n\nFOLLOW ME AROUND  \nInstagram : http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook : http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter : http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest : http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube : http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nTik Tok : Baileysarian\nSnapchat : BaileySarian \n\nEmail/PR Contact ( business only ) : bxsarian@gmail.com\n\n________\n\nShop My Amazon Favorites : https://amzn.to/2sZwvTV  \n\n________\n\n           \u2605 Products Used \u2605\n\nEYES \nPLouise Base Eyeshadow Primer Shade 2 - http://bit.ly/2BturIo \nMelt Cosmetics Four Twenty Eyeshadow Palette - https://bit.ly/3gVUXML\nUrban Decay Perversion Mascara - https://bit.ly/2Cq4ixy\nArdell Lashes Demi Wispies - https://bit.ly/3j2C0Kz \n\nFACE\nLorac Pro Soft Focus Longwear Foundation Shade 6 - https://bit.ly/36fp5Pd\nJouer Essential High Coverage Concealer Shade Custard - https://bit.ly/3etGya8 \nHuda Beauty Baking Powder Shade Cookie - https://bit.ly/2ZnlkVW  \nSmashbox Contour Palette - https://bit.ly/2YLMdkF \nColourpop Blush Shade No Vacancy - https://bit.ly/38NJVXj \n\nBROWS\nLime Crime Bushy Brow Shade Brownie - https://go.magik.ly/ml/w912/ \n\nLIPS \nMAC Lip Liner Shade Boldly Bare - https://bit.ly/2WNOQUJ  \nHuda Beauty Lipstick Shade Board Meeting - https://bit.ly/2DslVgC \n\n\u2661 \n\n*These links are affiliate links. which means, if you click on the link and purchase product, a small percentage comes back to me.
