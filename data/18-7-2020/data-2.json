Cara is pregnant! Completely unexpected surprise pregnancy. For Gemma and the Triplets we tried for a year with no success, and later found out she has PCOS and doesn't ovulate correctly, so she got medical help and took a pill (letrozole) to help her ovulate and it did the trick for both pregnancies. We figured that if we wanted to get pregnant again she would have to go on that pill again. We weren't opposed to having more kids, but definitely thought at least 2 years before she got back on it. So this came out of nowhere. We truly believe everything happens for a reason, and that this baby is supposed to be a part of our family. Those struggling with infertility, we have family members going through the same thing, and although we will never know why certain things happen, we just pray that you will still stay strong and positive. Never give up! We are so excited for baby number 5 to join us and so are the kids! Their reaction videos were all filmed prior to this since we have known for 3 weeks, and we will show those soon. The main question we have is will it be multiples again??? Twins? Another triplet pregnancy?! haha that would be absolutely insane, but you never what will happen around here anymore.

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! \n\nI specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. \n\nI also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. \nI will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! \n\nOn this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes \u201cgimmicky\u201d golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. \n\nIf you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AmyFEZk8fQU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AmyFEZk8fQU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AmyFEZk8fQU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AmyFEZk8fQU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AmyFEZk8fQU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Rick Shiels Golf", "tags": ["Golf", "Golf Tips", "Golf Advice", "How to play better golf", "Rick Shiels PGA", "Rick Shiels golf", "review club lesson", "Golf lessons", "Manchester", "Rick Shiels PGA Golf Coach", "Online golf", "facebook golf", "twitter golf", "rickshielspga", "rickshielsgolf", "tiger", "woods", "Rory Mcilroy", "Stop slicing", "stop hooking", "how to play golf", "improve ball striking", "stop shanks", "reduce handicap", "become a better golfer", "Golf balls", "Titleist", "Callaway", "Taylor Made", "Ping"], "categoryId": "17", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en-GB", "localized": {"title": "Full bag of ILLEGAL GOLF CLUBS & BALL!", "description": "FULL BAG OF ILLEGAL GOLF CLUBS & BALL! \nIn this video PGA golf professional heads out to The Marriott Worsley Park Golf & Country club to play golf with ALL illegal (non conforming) golf balls & ball!\n\nRick has the Hammer X driver, the 750cc driver the swingless golf club the ultimate straight golf ball and several other illegal golf clubs! \n\nWill Rick go super low and shoot under par?
