I love that the front end maintains the boxiness that the new Defender lost. \n\nLike the Wrangler, Bronco gets hard or soft-top options, and drivers can remove door panels and the roof both of which are stowable onboard. I dig the proportions of the body with the greenhouse. It\u2019s got side-hinged tailgate with good storage in the back. This thing looks great, full stop, and ready for whatever you throw at it. \n\nInside, Ford takes the less-is-more approach inspired by the first-generation Bronco.  A touchscreen is implemented for infotainment purposes, but there are some knobs and buttons for climate and audio functions. A digital gauge screen comes as an option as well. \r\rThe auxiliary toggle switches on the roof might be my favorite feature. There\u2019s even an optional GoPro mount on the dash for those interested in recording their adventures. \r\r\n\n\r\rSpeaking of, let\u2019s get into those powertrain details. The base Bronco gets Ford\u2019s 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine. (270 hp/310 lb-ft torque \u2013 projected numbers). There\u2019s also the 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 option (310 hp/400 lb-ft torque \u2013 projected numbers) if you\u2019re looking for more buck. \n\nA 7-speed manual is available on the 4-cylinder only. But that transmission is a special one. It gets six gears and a special crawler gear for some serious dirt chewing. The 4-banger and the V6 can also come with Ford\u2019s 10-speed automatic transmission. \r\r\n\nTwo transfer case options are available, one an electronic shift on the fly the other an electromechanical transfer case. \r\rThe crawl ratio on a Bronco equipped with that upgraded transfer case and the manual transmission with its special crawl gear is a brain exploding 94.75:1. As my good friend Emme said, that thing will basically drive itself. \r\rCapability wise, the Bronco looks stellar. When properly spec\u2019ed, approach, departure, and breakover angles best the Rubicon and keep in step with Land Rover\u2019s new ultra-capable Defender.  \r\r\n\n \r\rStep up with your cash and front and rear lockers and a front disconnecting stabilization bar are available as well. \r\rThe new Bronco gets an independent front suspension with coil-overs. The rear set up is a solid five-link axle also with coils.

I love that the front end maintains the boxiness that the new Defender lost. \n\nLike the Wrangler, Bronco gets hard or soft-top options, and drivers can remove door panels and the roof both of which are stowable onboard. I dig the proportions of the body with the greenhouse. It\u2019s got side-hinged tailgate with good storage in the back. This thing looks great, full stop, and ready for whatever you throw at it. \n\nInside, Ford takes the less-is-more approach inspired by the first-generation Bronco.  A touchscreen is implemented for infotainment purposes, but there are some knobs and buttons for climate and audio functions. A digital gauge screen comes as an option as well. \r\rThe auxiliary toggle switches on the roof might be my favorite feature. There\u2019s even an optional GoPro mount on the dash for those interested in recording their adventures. \r\r\n\n\r\rSpeaking of, let\u2019s get into those powertrain details. The base Bronco gets Ford\u2019s 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine. (270 hp/310 lb-ft torque \u2013 projected numbers). There\u2019s also the 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 option (310 hp/400 lb-ft torque \u2013 projected numbers) if you\u2019re looking for more buck. \n\nA 7-speed manual is available on the 4-cylinder only. But that transmission is a special one. It gets six gears and a special crawler gear for some serious dirt chewing. The 4-banger and the V6 can also come with Ford\u2019s 10-speed automatic transmission. \r\r\n\nTwo transfer case options are available, one an electronic shift on the fly the other an electromechanical transfer case. \r\rThe crawl ratio on a Bronco equipped with that upgraded transfer case and the manual transmission with its special crawl gear is a brain exploding 94.75:1. As my good friend Emme said, that thing will basically drive itself. \r\rCapability wise, the Bronco looks stellar. When properly spec\u2019ed, approach, departure, and breakover angles best the Rubicon and keep in step with Land Rover\u2019s new ultra-capable Defender.  \r\r\n\n \r\rStep up with your cash and front and rear lockers and a front disconnecting stabilization bar are available as well. \r\rThe new Bronco gets an independent front suspension with coil-overs.

To support future projects like this check out my patreon: http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere\n\nIf you like this project you'll probably like my iPad case that lets you see blindfolded.\n\nThe possibilities for this kind machine are endless with the most interesting things being haircuts that are too hard for human hair cutters to achieve. Imagine a mathematically perfect fade from one side of your head to another. Or imagine if I added a trimmer to this and cutting perfect lithopane pattern into your hair.  I consider this the first generation machine and hope to build another to explore some of the crazier haircut concepts.  A colleague suggested adding a precision hair dying attachment and doing some crazy multi-color hair styles. I wouldn't say that's really \"my jam\" but I might try it in the name of science & engineering. \n\nThis isn't just limited to humans either. Imagine sticking a poodle in this or making a bigger one to create topiaries.

To support future projects like this check out my patreon: http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere\n\nIf you like this project you'll probably like my iPad case that lets you see blindfolded.\n\nThe possibilities for this kind machine are endless with the most interesting things being haircuts that are too hard for human hair cutters to achieve. Imagine a mathematically perfect fade from one side of your head to another. Or imagine if I added a trimmer to this and cutting perfect lithopane pattern into your hair.  I consider this the first generation machine and hope to build another to explore some of the crazier haircut concepts.  A colleague suggested adding a precision hair dying attachment and doing some crazy multi-color hair styles.
