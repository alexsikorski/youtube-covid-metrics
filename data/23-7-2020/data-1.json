Summer break is the best time of year. I love taking my time during bright summer mornings. This video shows the difference between two very different people. The girl is super girly and loves to have a long morning workout. She loves to pamper herself with a long shower. She has her shaving routine, hair care routine and of course her summer make up routine for a fun day at the beach. However, the boy, Raja, wakes up bright and early and loves to catch up on some reading and summer homework. He makes his way to his job and of course visits his crush at work. Both the boy and girl are sooo different. Get ready with me summer edition. Enjoy Popular Girl vs Nerdy Boy. \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToDanAndRiya |\r\nWatch the latest: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAO4pwUNrMbweCYb-WN-9dH7tcUPHF49&playnext=1&index=2\r\n\r\n\u2666 WATCH MORE:\r\nBeverly Valley High: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAO4pwUNrMbEaCVTwVcwdPMEodO3gPob&playnext=1&index=2\r\nThe Skits!: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAO4pwUNrMacBYHh3XmGeYktbFFuiEBm&playnext=1&index=2\r\nTypes of: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAO4pwUNrMYq2VnAFsj0cim_uYr0o7Yy&playnext=1&index=2\r\nMost Popular: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAO4pwUNrMYY6AMwIwoMi_BjBj4vm0EI&playnext=1&index=2\r\n\r\n\u2666 SOCIAL MEDIA \r\no FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/DanAndRiya\r\no DAN'S TWITTER: https://twitter.com/dankipnis\r\no RIYA'S TWITTER: https://twitter.com/itsriyamalik\r\no DAN'S INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/dankipnis\r\no RIYA'S INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/itsriyamalik\r\no BEVERLY VALLEY HIGH INSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/beverlyvalleyhigh/\r\n\r\nDAN AND RIYA PLAY: https://youtube.com/channel/UCTgba6LZvaX2UhxX4uJpTkQ\r\n\r\nAbout Dan & Riya:\r\nWelcome to the Dan and Riya channel!
