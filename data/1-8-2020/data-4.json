Whether it\u2019s money, fame or simply an addiction to lying, we find out what motivated these tricksters and whether the highs, lows and ramifications were worth it in the end.\n \nIn this episode of Fakes, Frauds & Scammers, we meet Elliot Castro who as a teenager stole \u00a32.5m through credit card fraud and blasted the lot on Rolex watches, cars, top-end restaurants and five-star hotels in every country in Europe. But it wasn\u2019t long before his champagne lifestyle would spell his downfall.  \n\nhttps://instagram.com/elliotcastroooo\n \nhttps://soundcloud.com/elliotcastro\n \nhttps://facebook.com/elliotcastromusic\n\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

\u2018cardigan\u2019 Lyrics\nWritten by Taylor Swift & Aaron Dessner\n\nVintage tee, brand new phone High heels on cobblestones\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing Sequin smile, black lipstick\nSensual politics\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew you Dancing in your Levi\u2019s\nDrunk under a streetlight I knew you\nHand under my sweatshirt Baby kiss it better\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone\u2019s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite\n\nA friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew you\nPlaying hide-and-seek and Giving me your weekends I knew you\nYour heartbeat on the High Line Once in twenty lifetimes\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone\u2019s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite\n\nTo kiss in cars and downtown bars Was all we needed\nYou drew stars around my scars But now I\u2019m bleeding\n\nCause I knew you Stepping on the last train\n \nMarked me like a bloodstain I knew you\nTried to change the ending Peter losing Wendy\nI knew you\nLeaving like a father Running like water\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing But I knew you\u2019d linger like a tattoo kiss\nI knew you\u2019d haunt all of my what-ifs\nThe smell of smoke would hang around this long Cause I knew everything when I was young\nI knew I\u2019d curse you for the longest time Chasing shadows in the grocery line\nI knew you\u2019d miss me once the thrill expired And you\u2019d be standing in my front porch light And I knew you\u2019d come back to me\nYou\u2019d come back to me And you\u2019d come back to me And you\u2019d come back\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someone\u2019s bed\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite\n\n#TaylorSwift #cardigan #folklore", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K-a8s8OLBSE/default.jpg", "width": 120,

mcquire  \n\nstoryboards\nvincent lucido\n\nexecutive producer\nrebecca skinner\n\nA special thank you to our on set medics, COVID-19 compliance personnel and the crew for operating under the strictest guidelines including wearing PPE, practicing thorough sanitization and respecting social distancing during the video shoot.\n\nOfficial \u2018cardigan\u2019 Lyrics\nWritten by Taylor Swift & Aaron Dessner\n\nVintage tee, brand new phone High heels on cobblestones\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing Sequin smile, black lipstick\nSensual politics\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew you Dancing in your Levi\u2019s\nDrunk under a streetlight I knew you\nHand under my sweatshirt Baby kiss it better\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone\u2019s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite\n\nA friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew you\nPlaying hide-and-seek and Giving me your weekends I knew you\nYour heartbeat on the High Line Once in twenty lifetimes\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone\u2019s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite\n\nTo kiss in cars and downtown bars Was all we needed\nYou drew stars around my scars But now I\u2019m bleeding\n\nCause I knew you Stepping on the last train\n \nMarked me like a bloodstain I knew you\nTried to change the ending Peter losing Wendy\nI knew you\nLeaving like a father Running like water\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing But I knew you\u2019d linger like a tattoo kiss\nI knew you\u2019d haunt all of my what-ifs\nThe smell of smoke would hang around this long Cause I knew everything when I was young\nI knew I\u2019d curse you for the longest time Chasing shadows in the grocery line\nI knew you\u2019d miss me once the thrill expired And you\u2019d be standing in my front porch light And I knew you\u2019d come back to me\nYou\u2019d come back to me And you\u2019d come back to me And you\u2019d come back\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someone\u2019s bed\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite\n\n#TaylorSwift #cardigan #folklore"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT4M35S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "regionRestriction":
