Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning!

Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.\n\n(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)\n\nThe idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her \"10 Dates in 10 Days\" and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!\n\nEach boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) \n\nMatt, who is in flight school, is super thoughtful and did a great job planning his date! He made the cutest picnic lunch for for them beside the lake, including a yummy caesar salad! Then they went paddle boarding. \n\nIs this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*\n\nIf this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???\n\nThis video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)\n\nThe idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her \"10 Dates in 10 Days\" and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!\n\nEach boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) \n\nMatt, who is in flight school, is super thoughtful and did a great job planning his date! He made the cutest picnic lunch for for them beside the lake, including a yummy caesar salad! Then they went paddle boarding. \n\nIs this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*\n\nIf this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???\n\nThis video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

So after finding the 'perfect' (his words, not ours) '71 Caprice, it was only a matter of time before he brought it to the Donut Garage as our newest project car. The goal? 1000hp. Good paint.

outside, the lil' bitch is ready to go\nGot a Sig Sauer, it's brown like boot\nIt's still my brother, that nigga the truth, nigga the truth\nTwenty-five thousand for eight of my teeth\nThree thousand dollars for each every tooth\nIn too close, pull back the top, shoot out the roof (Brrt), go poof\nI'ma start puttin' these bitches on MARTA\nI'ma stop puttin' broke hoes on charters\nBrother too muddy, he been through too much\nIf you standin' and talkin', might black out the water\nI was twenty years old with six different whips\nPerfect good health, but bought ten different scripts (Woo)\nDawg, it's cheaper to boot her out\nWhen niggas be flexin', nah, this ain't the same\nPromise it's more for my shit plain\nNiggas ain't P's, be lookin' like change\nDon't you forget who showed you more\nShowed you the life and you thought it was strange\nHad the driver pick your ass up from LaGrange\nIn a black Range, I forgot bad hoes could be lame\n\n[Chorus: Future & Lil Yachty]\nPardon

sad\nNow my ex bitch calling back\nSaw me come up out the random\nDidn\u2019t wait long, now that bitch throwing tantrums Her friends fell in love when I fell under fame\nIn my DMs talking \u2018bout, \u201cHey handsome\u201d\n\n[Post-Chorus: iann dior]\nI know that they hate me and want me for ransom \nIt\u2019s nothing new I won\u2019t give it to them\nI eat the hate up and spit it right back\nMy lyrics like bullets, I\u2019m shooting your ass \nWomen come, and go with the cash\nYou gon\u2019 learn, and learn that shit fast\nThey gon\u2019 fold, fold under act\nI get my medicine straight out the bag\n\n[Verse 1: iann dior]\nI\u2019m a prospect, not from Earth\nI feel like a martian\nMatter of fact bitch, I came from a starship\nMy bed feel like a coffin\nNot waking up, if I run into opps Ima off \u2018em\nI don\u2019t know if you think that you stoppin\u2019\nWhat I got going on\nGot a semi with auto on\nThis ain\u2019t no auto correct, bitch this a threat\nNow I\u2019m coming at your neck\nN**** act cute like a pet\nSoft like a pop tart, Atlanta got no heart\nY'all be the ones that's pretendin\u2019\nInsecurities they always offended\nMad about a bitch I already been in\nThat bitch for everybody, we ain\u2019t spoke in a minute N**** still in the picture, \nand I\u2019m still leaving with her It ain\u2019t nothing, I\u2019m a rebel\n\n [Bridge: iann dior]\nI can\u2019t conform\nI ain\u2019t falling back, no\nShe need more, she got too attached, ha \nAddicted to me like I\u2019m on one\nThree thousand for that new red car \nWalk around look like a mummy \nPsychedelics in my tummy\nSwipe swipe, Ima get it all\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: iann dior]\nNowadays I get what I want\nLately been spending a bag\nAddicted to getting that cash\nAddicted to popping them tags\nMoney was made for the sad\nNow my ex bitch calling back\nSaw me come up out the random\nDidn\u2019t wait long, now that bitch throwing tantrums \nHer friends fell in love when I fell under fame\nIn my DMs talking \u2018bout, \u201cHey handsome\u201d\n\n[Post-Chorus: iann dior]\nI know that they hate me and want me for ransom \nIt\u2019s nothing new I won\u2019t give it to them\nI eat

under act\nI get my medicine straight out the bag\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Baby]\nBrand new corvette, come through smashing the gas \nThey made me mad now I\u2019m back in my bag\nI hope my man in my side never crash\nWipe out the Cat tryna dodge my past\nWe catch that boy then we robbin\u2019 his ass\nIt\u2019s the principle, I don\u2019t need the cash\nExpensive dishes, half a million on lashes\nI can kick it but I don\u2019t like to brag\nHoe done made mad, I\u2019m bouta turn up\n\nI got my glizzy wish a n**** run up\nYou could come get your bitch, \u2018cause I don\u2019t want her \nI ran my millions up from out the corner\nI\u2019m the one out here doing what I wanna\nMy lil bro run it up off marijuana\nGrind in the winter, turn up in the summer\nTraphouse with sport, I press it then I launch it\nI\u2019m thanking God, ain\u2019t no more free lunches\nGot suspended me and *****\nHouse up on the hill, I used to want it\nNow I got it, I don\u2019t even stay there\nI get even, I don\u2019t play fair\nProbably spent me a million on haters\nOn they top, make em drop\nAnd I don\u2019t give a fuck \u2018bout no cops\n\n[Chorus: iann dior]\nGet what I want\nLately been spending a bag\nAddicted to getting that cash\nAddicted to popping them tags\nMoney was made for the sad\nNow my ex bitch calling back\nSaw me come up out the random\nDidn\u2019t wait long, now that bitch throwing tantrums \nHer friends fell in love when I fell under fame\nIn my DMs talking \u2018bout, \u201cHey handsome\u201d\n\n[Post-Chorus: iann dior]\nI know that they hate me and want me for ransom
