I to do?\nWhat the fuck am I to do?\nWhat the fuck am I to do?\nWhat the fuck am I to do?\nWhen there's nothin' left...\n\n\nCause I don't wanna feel shit, someone must've hit a kill switch\nThey don't ask about the problems that I deal with\nFuck all of this money you can have it I don't feel rich\nI keep havin' these flashbacks I hate 'em\nThey remind me of my problems, I can't stand to face 'em\nI know it's prolly my last to change 'em\nBut even if I do it my past can't erase it\nThey recognize me 'cause they see me on the internet\nThey think I owe 'em somethin' I can't deal with all the disrespect\nSick to my stomach, when I feel it I just disconnect\nMy demons tend get the best of me when I get depressed\nI've been stabbed in the back with a chainsaw\nBut who am I to blame y'all, I'm smokin 'til the pain's gone\nYou see me smilin on the surface tryna stay strong\nActin' like I'm happy starts to feel like it's my day job\nBut just as long as there's a purpose to it all\nI'll keep tourin workin' hard, writin verses to these songs\nFar from perfect, every person has their flaws\nAnd mine is I'm an addict still searchin for a cause\nI know they judge me for mistakes that I've made\nSince I've gained all this fame shit just ain't been the same\nI came in the game to pave a lane for my name\nAnd it's painful to say it put's restraints on my brain but\nI know it's worth it cause I get to tell my story\nI'm at a point where the industry can't ignore me\nI never had the main stream media to endorse me\nI did this all by me and myself and y'all are corny\nTo every kid that's listenin to this song\nI hope you've found the message I've written within it all\nIf no one's ever there to pick you up when you fall\nI promise you're not alone, play this

somethin' to relate to\nI know the feelin' like the whole world hates you\nI know you wishin' you could finally have a breakthrough\nYou thought it was a phase so you pretend you're in a great mood\nI know it hurts to see reflections of yourself\n'Cause the person that you see is not like everybody else\nSo you try and you try but it never seems to help\nSo you're questionin' your words 'cause you're so fed up with the guilt\nBut...\nYou're not the only one that's goin' through regret\nYou're not the only one that no one seems to get\nYou're not the only one that's so close to the edge\nAnd if you slip it's over for you so you cope with it instead\nI can promise you that nobody is perfect and you overthink the little shit you're always so concerned with\nSo you lock yourself inside everynight and close the curtains\nAnd you're screamin' out loud but it's like no one even heard it\nI know problems keep pilin' up right in front of you\nSo much anxiety inside you don't know what to do\nBeen lied to so much you that you don't think you even want the truth\nFuck it, aww you grew to be used it, it ain't nothin' new\nI been there too, just hold tight\nA lot of substance abuse and

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all \"secretly\" hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Matt today, after meeting Kohl, Ethan, and Jorge previously. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!\n\n\u2705 Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com \n\nOur friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! \n\nAlyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w \nBetsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw \n\nWhen Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.\n\n(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)\n\nThe idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her \"10 Dates in 10 Days\" and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!\n\nEach boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) \n\nMatt, who is in flight school, is super thoughtful and did a great job planning his date! He made the cutest picnic lunch for for them beside the lake, including a yummy caesar salad! Then they went paddle boarding. \n\nIs this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*\n\nIf this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???\n\nThis video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all \"secretly\" hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Matt today, after meeting Kohl, Ethan, and Jorge previously. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!\n\n\u2705 Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com \n\nOur friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! \n\nAlyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w \nBetsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw \n\nWhen Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.\n\n(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)\n\nThe idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her \"10 Dates in 10 Days\" and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!\n\nEach boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) \n\nMatt, who is in flight school, is super thoughtful and did a great job planning his date! He made the cutest picnic lunch for for them beside the lake, including a yummy caesar salad! Then they went paddle boarding. \n\nIs this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*\n\nIf this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???\n\nThis video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.
