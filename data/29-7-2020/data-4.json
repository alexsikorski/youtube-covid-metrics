dreams\nWhole squad mobbin even though we only six deep\nI was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys\nWalking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze\nI was blowing smoke had me dizzy like Gillespie\nNiggas had no homes we were living in the dead streets\nYou couldn\u2019t find me like I\u2019m Hoffa\nCover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups\nSpending all my money on these niggas that I brought up\nTaking care of families for my brothers when they are locked up\nAnd I had nothing to believe in\nDouble cup leanin\nCouldn\u2019t even breathe and\nFor that money I was fiending\nCali was the mission but now a nigga leaving\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nleaving into the night oh\nShe like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship\nFuturistic sex give her Phillip K dick\nShe never need a man, she what a man need\nSo I could keep on falling for her daily\nWe was at Coachella going brazy\nStack a couple M\u2019s like I was shady\nNow I\u2019m in Tribeca like I\u2019m Jay-Z\nRockin Sorayama like he pay me\nI just signed a new deal with Mercedes\nGot me movin dirty like I\u2019m Swayze\nAll my diamonds dancing like they Swayze\nAll my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee\nJet so big got a business and a coach\nI was always on the road rockin Louis a la mode nigga\nAnd for that money I was fiending\nCali was the mission but now a nigga leaving\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nleaving into the night oh\n20 mill mansion never lived in\nZero edge pool never dipped in it\nSuperstar neighbor in my business\nPaparazzi tryna catch me sleepin and\nGoing on tour is my vacation\nEvery month another accusation\nOnly thing I\u2019m phobic of is failing\nI was never blessed with any patience\nSo a nigga leaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nleaving into the night oh\n\n#TheWeeknd #Snowchild #AfterHours", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url":

then I\u2019d probably make my wrist bleed\nNot to mislead turn my nightmares into big dreams\nWhole squad mobbin even though we only six deep\nI was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys\nWalking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze\nI was blowing smoke had me dizzy like Gillespie\nNiggas had no homes we were living in the dead streets\nYou couldn\u2019t find me like I\u2019m Hoffa\nCover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups\nSpending all my money on these niggas that I brought up\nTaking care of families for my brothers when they are locked up\nAnd I had nothing to believe in\nDouble cup leanin\nCouldn\u2019t even breathe and\nFor that money I was fiending\nCali was the mission but now a nigga leaving\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nleaving into the night oh\nShe like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship\nFuturistic sex give her Phillip K dick\nShe never need a man, she what a man need\nSo I could keep on falling for her daily\nWe was at Coachella going brazy\nStack a couple M\u2019s like I was shady\nNow I\u2019m in Tribeca like I\u2019m Jay-Z\nRockin Sorayama like he pay me\nI just signed a new deal with Mercedes\nGot me movin dirty like I\u2019m Swayze\nAll my diamonds dancing like they Swayze\nAll my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee\nJet so big got a business and a coach\nI was always on the road rockin Louis a la mode nigga\nAnd for that money I was fiending\nCali was the mission but now a nigga leaving\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nleaving into the night oh\n20 mill mansion never lived in\nZero edge pool never dipped in it\nSuperstar neighbor in my business\nPaparazzi tryna catch me sleepin and\nGoing on tour is my vacation\nEvery month another accusation\nOnly thing I\u2019m phobic of is failing\nI was never blessed with any patience\nSo a nigga leaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nleaving into the night oh\n\n#TheWeeknd #Snowchild #AfterHours"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT4M12S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "regionRestriction":
