(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all \"secretly\" hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!\n\n\u2705 Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com \n\nOur friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! \n\nAlyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w \nBetsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw \n\nWhen Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.\n\n(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)\n\nThe idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her \"10 Dates in 10 Days\" and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!\n\nEach boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) \n\nKohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series???

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all \"secretly\" hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!\n\n\u2705 Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com \n\nOur friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! \n\nAlyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w \nBetsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw \n\nWhen Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.\n\n(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)\n\nThe idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her \"10 Dates in 10 Days\" and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!\n\nEach boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) \n\nKohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities!
