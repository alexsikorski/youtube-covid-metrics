Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! \n\nOn this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes \u201cgimmicky\u201d golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. \n\nIf you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoki_izFGOg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoki_izFGOg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoki_izFGOg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoki_izFGOg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoki_izFGOg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Rick Shiels Golf", "tags": ["Golf", "Golf Tips", "Golf Advice", "How to play better golf", "Rick Shiels PGA", "Rick Shiels golf", "review club lesson", "Golf lessons", "Manchester", "Rick Shiels PGA Golf Coach", "Online golf", "facebook golf", "twitter golf", "rickshielspga", "rickshielsgolf", "tiger", "woods", "Rory Mcilroy", "Stop slicing", "stop hooking", "how to play golf", "improve ball striking", "stop shanks", "reduce handicap", "become a better golfer", "Golf balls", "Titleist", "Callaway", "Taylor Made", "Ping"], "categoryId": "17", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en-GB", "localized": {"title": "MY NEW IRONS | LOVE THEM", "description": "Rick Shiels PGA golf professional has been looking for a new set of irons for a number of months now and in this video he has finally found a set of golf irons that he hopes will improve his golf game and lower his scores.\n\nFor the past 12 months or so Rick Shiels has been using the Ping Blueprint golf irons but he has come to the conclusion that they aren\u2019t forgiving enough.
