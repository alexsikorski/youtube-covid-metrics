and strong you must do one thing in your workouts. You have to remember to make progressive overload the guiding principle of your training. You simply cannot force your body to build muscle if you are keeping the status quo on the effort you are putting into your workouts. In this video, I\u2019m going to dispel the myth however that progressive overload means simply adding more weight to the bar. There are many more ways to achieve this, and in doing so, many more opportunities for you to build muscle and get strong.\n\nThat said, it is important for you to first identify what your specific goal is. Are you looking to just get strong, just build muscle, or both? They both can be accomplished simultaneously, it just means that each will be compromised somewhat along the way. We can minimize the compromises if we know how to get big and strong the right way.\n\nTo illustrate the differences in approaches we are going to take a classic bodybuilding exercise for building bigger biceps like the dumbbell curl and pit it up against one of the most classic and effective compound lifts - the deadlift. As you\u2019ll see, many of the techniques can be applied to each lift in a slightly different application but with the same end goal.\n\nWe know that the easiest way to create progressive overload and build strength and muscle size is to do exactly what we said however and add weight to the bar or dumbbell that you are lifting. As strength increases, often times, so too does muscle growth albeit at a slower pace (especially at the beginning of your training).\n\nNext we can increase overall volume as long as the volume is of sufficient enough intensity to push your body to adapt in the form of increased muscle size and strength. The key here is to not confuse junk volume for effective volume. Lifting sub maximal weights that are greatly beneath your strength capacity is not going to trigger enough of a response to get either stronger or bigger.\n\nWhich brings us to effort level. Not talking about intensity as defined in the realm of strength as a percentage of a max but rather simply about the amount of effort you are directing into your training. If you are lazily lifting your weights rather than attacking them with a focused intention, then you are likely leaving many gains on the table and missing an obvious opportunity for overload.\n\nWe don\u2019t always have to focus on how much we are lifting to ensure progressive overload. We can focus on how long we rest between sets that we are performing to achieve an progression as well. If your sets and reps are the same and the intensity is consistent but you decreased the rest time between sets by even just one minute, your second workout would serve as a form of overload and drive positive adaptations.\n\nRange of motion is another way we can increase the effectiveness of an exercise from workout to workout without having to change the amount of weight on the bar. Performing either a deficit deadlift or a one and a half rep curl are going to increase the travel of the bar or dumbbell respectively on every rep and therefore create more work for the muscles you are training.\n\nThe range itself however does not always have to be lengthened. You can increase the \u201ceffective\u201d range by taking advantage of accommodating resistance and overlapping strength curves. The inclusion of a band on a dumbbell curl or chains on a deadlift will help you to better match the strength curve of the exercise for a longer part of the range - thereby increasing it\u2019s overall effectiveness.\n\nSpeed and momentum are also methods that can be manipulated for overload and are discussed in more detail in the video.\n\nThe key is that thinking that adding more weight to the bar is the only way for you to achieve progressive overload and get bigger and stronger is a myth. The schooled strength coach will be capable of steering you away from this and show you how not only to increase your lifting capacity but also to build size and strength through other methods.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a step by step program for building bigger muscles and getting stronger, you can find them at athleanx.com via the link below. All of the plans are presented in a step by step, day by day manner so you can follow along and make sure that you never miss a beat on your way to making improvements and training like an athlete. \n\nFor more videos on how to get strong and how to get big muscles, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it\u2019s published. \n\nBuild Muscle in 90 Days - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://youtube.com/user/jdcav24", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-hYld_0TT_4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-hYld_0TT_4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-hYld_0TT_4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-hYld_0TT_4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-hYld_0TT_4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "ATHLEAN-X\u2122", "tags": ["how to get big", "how to get strong", "how to get bigger", "how to get stronger", "how to get big and strong", "how to get big muscles", "how to get strong muscles", "how to get bigger muscles", "how to get stronger muscles", "how to increase strength", "how to increase muscle size", "how to get jacked", "get strong", "get stronger", "get big", "get bigger", "workout to get big", "workout to get stronger", "athleanx", "athlean x", "jeff cavaliere"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "How to Get Big and Strong (JUST DO THIS!)", "description": "If you want to get big and strong you must do one thing in your workouts. You have to remember to make progressive overload the guiding principle of your training. You simply cannot force your body to build muscle if you are keeping the status quo on the effort you are putting into your workouts. In this video, I\u2019m going to dispel the myth however that progressive overload means simply adding more weight to the bar. There are many more ways to achieve this, and in doing so, many more opportunities for you to build muscle and get strong.\n\nThat said, it is important for you to first identify what your specific goal is. Are you looking to just get strong, just build muscle, or both? They both can be accomplished simultaneously, it just means that each will be compromised somewhat along the way. We can minimize the compromises if we know how to get big and strong the right way.\n\nTo illustrate the differences in approaches we are going to take a classic bodybuilding exercise for building bigger biceps like the dumbbell curl and pit it up against one of the most classic and effective compound lifts - the deadlift. As you\u2019ll see, many of the techniques can be applied to each lift in a slightly different application but with the same end goal.\n\nWe know that the easiest way to create progressive overload and build strength and muscle size is to do exactly what we said however and add weight to the bar or dumbbell that you are lifting. As strength increases, often times, so too does muscle growth albeit at a slower pace (especially at the beginning of your training).\n\nNext we can increase overall volume as long as the volume is of sufficient enough intensity to push your body to adapt in the form of increased muscle size and strength. The key here is to not confuse junk volume for effective volume. Lifting sub maximal weights that are greatly beneath your strength capacity is not going to trigger enough of a response to get either stronger or bigger.\n\nWhich brings us to effort level. Not talking about intensity as defined in the realm of strength as a percentage of a max but rather simply about the amount of effort you are directing into your training. If you are lazily lifting your weights rather than attacking them with a focused intention, then you are likely leaving many gains on the table and missing an obvious opportunity for overload.\n\nWe don\u2019t always have to focus on how much we are lifting to ensure progressive overload.

the most technically ambitious projects in aviation history. Billions were spent on its development over a span of more than a decade. When the Concorde program was launched, it was to be the next giant leap forward in air travel. Many believed that mass supersonic commercial air travel would be commonplace by the end of the 1970s. \n\nBy the early 1960s, both the British and French had come up with early designs for supersonic airliners. As both efforts moved toward the prototype phase, it increasingly made sense for the two countries to work together to shoulder development costs and the immense technical hurdles. Britain and France formally partnered to launch the Concorde program by signing a treaty in 1962.\n\nThousands of the brightest French and British engineers were dedicated to making supersonic air travel a reality. By 1963, mockups of Concorde were already capturing the world\u2019s imagination and dazzling the press. Airlines soon placed orders for more than 70 Concordes. Orders were expected to grow to at least 200 by 1975.  The Soviet Union responded with the development of their own supersonic airliner and the United States launched the Supersonic Transport program. \n\nHowever, by the early 1970s, the prospect of mass supersonic travel began to fade. Concorde would enter commercial service in the mid-to-late 1970s, just as the price of oil began to skyrocket. Concorde burned nearly four times more fuel than even a first generation jetliner. Like all supersonic aircraft, Concorde generated sonic booms. Public tolerance for sonic booms had been underestimated, and as countries started banning supersonic flights over their airspace, limited route options made Concorde less appealing to airlines. By the end of 1973, nearly every airline cancelled their options. All the while, Concorde\u2019s development costs had ballooned to more than ten times original estimates. \n\nBritish Airways and Air France were ultimately the only airlines to put Concordes into service, taking delivery of just a handful of aircraft each.  The two airlines would eventually turn a profit by branding Concorde as an ultra-exclusive way to travel. Ticket prices were set as high as $12,000 for a London to New York round trip for the elite few who could afford the price of flying supersonic. While the prospect of mass supersonic travel never arrived, Concorde earned a legacy as an engineering marvel and symbol of pride for the British and French until it's retirement in 2003.\n\nSelect footage courtesy the AP Archive:\nAP Archive website: http://www.aparchive.com YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive and https://www.youtube.com/c/britishmovietone\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Arehart for helping clean up our audio:\nhttps://twitter.com/airhrt_\n\nLink to the Mustard Store:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/mustard-store\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\nIntro Song:  \u201cUpbeat Jazz\u201d - https://audiojungle.net/item/upbeat-jazz/19560759\n\nSong 2:    \u201cBritish Loop\u201d - https://audiojungle.net/item/british-loop/3940093\n\nSong 3:    \u201cFuture Innovation Technology\u201d - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/105925303-future-innovation-technologyinspirational-science-and-indust \n\nSong 4:  \u201cDocumentary Curious And Contemporary\u201d - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/124518398-documentary-curious-and-contemporary-60-sec-part-2\n\nSong 5:   \u201c80s Synthwave\u201d - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-synthwave/25916576\n\nSong 6:   \u201cRaw Cello\u201d - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/120023244-raw-cello-virtuoso-dramatic-solo-strings-epic-inspiring-cine\n\nSong 7:   \u201cAmbient Piano Documentary\u201d -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/123770319-ambient-piano-documentary\n\nSong 8:   \u201cInspirational Technology\u201d -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/100434966-inspirational-technologyfuture-and-fantasyscience-and-produc\n\nSong 9:   \u201c80s Synthwave\u201d\nhttps://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave/26328368", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFBvPue70l8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFBvPue70l8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFBvPue70l8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFBvPue70l8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFBvPue70l8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Mustard", "tags": ["Concorde", "Supersonic", "Supersonic Transport (SST)", "Supersonic Airliner", "Civil Aviation", "Commercial Aviation", "Sonic Boom", "Aviation Documentary", "Fastest Airliner", "A\u00e9rospatiale/BAC Concorde", "Supersonic Aircraft", "British Airways Concorde", "Air France Concorde", "Why was Concorde Expensive", "Why was Concorde Retired", "Concord", "Tu-144", "Boeing 2707", "Mustard"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Why You Couldn\u2019t Afford To Fly Concorde", "description": "Sign up for an annual CuriosityStream subscription and you\u2019ll also get a free Nebula subscription (the new streaming platform built by creators) here: http://CuriosityStream.com/mustard\n\nConcorde was the world\u2019s most iconic airliner and one of the most technically ambitious projects in aviation history.

Public tolerance for sonic booms had been underestimated, and as countries started banning supersonic flights over their airspace, limited route options made Concorde less appealing to airlines. By the end of 1973, nearly every airline cancelled their options. All the while, Concorde\u2019s development costs had ballooned to more than ten times original estimates. \n\nBritish Airways and Air France were ultimately the only airlines to put Concordes into service, taking delivery of just a handful of aircraft each.  The two airlines would eventually turn a profit by branding Concorde as an ultra-exclusive way to travel. Ticket prices were set as high as $12,000 for a London to New York round trip for the elite few who could afford the price of flying supersonic. While the prospect of mass supersonic travel never arrived, Concorde earned a legacy as an engineering marvel and symbol of pride for the British and French until it's retirement in 2003.\n\nSelect footage courtesy the AP Archive:\nAP Archive website: http://www.aparchive.com YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive and https://www.youtube.com/c/britishmovietone\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Arehart for helping clean up our audio:\nhttps://twitter.com/airhrt_\n\nLink to the Mustard Store:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/mustard-store\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\nIntro Song:  \u201cUpbeat Jazz\u201d - https://audiojungle.net/item/upbeat-jazz/19560759\n\nSong 2:    \u201cBritish Loop\u201d - https://audiojungle.net/item/british-loop/3940093\n\nSong 3:    \u201cFuture Innovation Technology\u201d - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/105925303-future-innovation-technologyinspirational-science-and-indust \n\nSong 4:  \u201cDocumentary Curious And Contemporary\u201d - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/124518398-documentary-curious-and-contemporary-60-sec-part-2\n\nSong 5:   \u201c80s Synthwave\u201d - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-synthwave/25916576\n\nSong 6:   \u201cRaw Cello\u201d - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/120023244-raw-cello-virtuoso-dramatic-solo-strings-epic-inspiring-cine\n\nSong 7:   \u201cAmbient Piano Documentary\u201d -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/123770319-ambient-piano-documentary\n\nSong 8:   \u201cInspirational Technology\u201d -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/100434966-inspirational-technologyfuture-and-fantasyscience-and-produc\n\nSong 9:   \u201c80s Synthwave\u201d\nhttps://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave/26328368"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT13M42S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "842171", "likeCount": "32634", "dislikeCount": "590", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "2918"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "rrKrjVItfmOGTiZPHTmRLGTRldQ", "id": "cpNocdyRB9c", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-07-19T19:16:37Z", "channelId": "UCMmVPVb0BwSIOWVeDwlPocQ", "title": "MANCHESTER UNITED vs CHELSEA With MARK GOLDBRIDGE LIVE", "description": "Manchester United vs Chelsea with Match Reaction https://youtu.be/_Xzldu_B3uQ.
