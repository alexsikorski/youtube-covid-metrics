It's another episode of squishy makeovers! Sorry it's been so long, this video was an incredible amount of work. OMG. But it was worth it! I hope you guys like it \ud83d\ude0a Due to popular request, I am letting a wheel choose my squishies at random again.\n\nWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Fixing and giving makeovers to squishies is such a fun painting project, and a great creative art activity. It's been keeping me busy for years \ud83d\ude02 Hopefully you like my creations this episode. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\n\n_________FAQs__________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. \n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh \ud83d\ude02 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

who I need, well I don\u2019t need shit\nOnly thing I need, is this glock 23 bitch \nFlying over seas, got a young nigga sea sick \nI was just posted in the street, like some cement (yeah, yeah, yeah)

you know I\u2019m born in Atlanta\nThey try to we start going and get em\nReally show me what it was, I'll probably never forgive you\nStart having what you aint had, and they\u2019ll look at you different\nBut it don\u2019t matter, I\u2019m in my bag, its getting bigger and bigger \n\nNow the Range Rover, class sport, and stamps on my passport \nNever know what tripping\u2019, I got everything I asked for\nYoung and out here rappin, I tried to tell that nigga to mask up \nWe got all the bags around the way, nigga\u2019s cant gas us\nI ain\u2019t really got too much to say, but fuck the task force\nKeep minding my business, hold my weight, and run my cash up\nSometimes I just ride round with my stick, inside my lamb truck\nEverywhere I go, somebody put me on they camera
